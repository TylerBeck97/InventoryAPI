This is the backend for the Inventory tracker mobile app. This project was done to gain basic familiarity with REST APIs.
The API handles all basic CRUD operations such as:
* Allowing the user to add new items to the table with a POST request
* Retrieving the list of items in the table with a GET request
* Removing items from the table with a DELETE request
* Updating quantity of items in the table with a PUT request
